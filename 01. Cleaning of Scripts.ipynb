The bells begin to quietly ring as he shakes the very building, ripping out pillars of stone. Finally he is freed. He races off and grabs a rope. Leaping off the edge of the cathedral, he lassos a gargoyle and rappels down the side of the building. Finally, he\\'s close enough. He jumps off, flies out over the crowd and lands on the platform. He quickly breaks Esmeralda\\'s ropes. A trio of guards come at him, but Quasi grabs a torch and swings it at them, scaring them off. He grabs the rope and climbs back to the top of the building.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> Quasimodo!\\n</p><p><i>(He reaches the top of the building and stands in front of the giant stained glass window.

You\\'ll be safe here.\\n</p><p><i>(Quasi leaps down, then grabs a beam of wood and throws it at the advancing soldiers on the ground. They scurry like ants.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> Come back, you cowards! (To guards at Phoebus\\' cage) You men! Pick up that beam! Break down the door!\\n</p><p><i>(The men oblige Frollo, leaving only Guard 2. Phoebus grabs him around the neck from inside the cage.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Phoebus:</b> Alone at last!\\n</p><p><i>(He bonks the guard on the head, and as Guard 2 falls to the ground, he grabs the keys to the lock. The guards, meanwhile, have begun battering the door. Phoebus unlocks himself, then leaps on top of the cage.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Phoebus:</b> Citizens of Paris! Frollo has persecuted our people, ransacked our city! Now he has declared war on Notre Dame herself!

Quasi continues to drop things on the advancing troops. Victor drops a brick, landing square on a guard\\'s head.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Victor:</b> Sorry! Sorry!\\n</p><p><i>(Hugo throws a rock in his mouth, then chomps it up, flies around like a bomber, ending up on the ledge. He begins spitting out pebbles like a machine gun. Meanwhile, Frollo is supervising the guards at the door.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Guard:</b> Harder!\\n</p><p><i>(As the fighting continues, a guard breaks the lock off the stockade. The old prisoner is once again free.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Old Prisoner:</b> I\\'m free! I\\'m free! <i>(He steps into a hole labeled \"Mon Sewer\".) </i>Dang it!\\n</p><p><i>(A grappling hook reaches Quasimodo. He grabs it, then pulls the rope tight. Three guards smash into the building. Meanwhile, Victor and Hugo are building a catapult. They finally are finished and ready to fire.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Victor:</b> Ready...aim...fire!\\n</p><p><i>(They push the catapult off the ledge, sending it crashing to the ground. Soldiers scatter as it hits.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Victor:</b> Are you sure that\\'s how it works?\\n</p><p><i>(The catapult, upside down, springs, sending the cart bottom on top of some soldiers.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Hugo:</b> Works for me!\\n</p><p><i>(More fighting. Once again, Guard 1 is defeated by Phoebus, and he ends up behind Achilles.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Phoebus:</b> Achilles! Sit!\\n</p><p><i>(And the horse obeys. Cut to Laverne, sending the birds to attack, ala The Wicked Witch of the West from \"</i>The Wizard of Oz.<i>\")</i>\\n</p><p><b>Laverne:</b> Fly, my pretties! Fly! Fly!\\n</p><p><i>(The guards continue to work on the door.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> Put your backs into it!\\n</p><p><i>(Meanwhile, Victor is using Hugo as a bellows to warm up the fire on the lead pot. Quasi attaches a rope to it, then dumps it over, sending fire pouring out of the tower and onto the scattering guards below. The guards battering the door run, but Frollo manages to get inside the cathedral safely. As he does, the archdeacon runs up to him.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Archdeacon:</b> Frollo, have you gone mad? I will not tolerate this assault on the house of God!\\n</p><p><i>(He shoves the archdeacon to the ground.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> Silence, you old fool! The hunchback and I have unfinished business to attend to. And this time, you will not interfere.\\n</p><p><i>(He closes the door and locks it from the inside. Upstairs, Quasi bursts into the bedroom jubilantly.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Quasimodo:</b> We\\'ve done it, Esmeralda! We\\'ve beaten them back! Come and see!\\n</p><p><i>(She doesn\\'t move.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Quasimodo:</b> Esmeralda? Wake up! You\\'re safe now.\\n</p><p><i>(He pauses, but still nothing.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Quasimodo:\\'</b> Esmeralda? Oh, no!\\n</p><p><i>(He gets a spoonful of water, and tries to make her drink it. She doesn\\'t.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Quasimodo:</b> Oh, no.\\n</p><p><i>(He begins to cry. Frollo enters and touches Quasi on his hump.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Quasimodo:</b> You \"killed\" her.\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> It was my duty, horrible as it was. I hope you can forgive me. There, there, Quasimodo, I know it hurts. But now, the time has come to end your suffering, forever.\\n</p><p><i>(We see that Frollo has a dagger. As Frollo raises it to stab him, Quasi sees the shadow of the dagger. He turns and struggles with Frollo only briefly, before wresting the dagger from Frollo\\'s hands and backing him into a corner.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> (cowardly) Now, now, listen to me, Quasimodo.\\n</p><p><b>Quasimodo:</b> (angry) No, you listen! All my life you have told me the world is a dark, cruel place. But now, I see that the only thing dark and cruel about it is people like you!\\n</p><p><i>(He throws away the dagger.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Esmeralda:</b> Quasimodo?\\n</p><p><i>(He turns and sees Esmeralda sitting on the bed.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Quasimodo:</b> Esmeralda!\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> She lives! <i>(he grabs a sword.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Quasimodo:</b> No!\\n</p><p><i>(He grabs Esmeralda and runs out onto the balcony. Frollo follows, but when he gets outside, he sees nothing but gargoyles (including a gargoyle (which represents <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Pumbaa\" title=\"w:c:disney:Pumbaa\">Pumbaa</a> from </i><span class=\"new\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVGhlX0xpb25fS2luZz9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=\" title=\"The Lion King (page does not exist)\">The Lion King</span><i>). After looking left and right, he looks out over the edge and finds Quasi hanging there with Esmeralda.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> Leaving so soon?\\n</p><p><i>(He swings his sword, but Quasi dodges the blow by swinging to another spot. Down on the ground, the guards stop to watch.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Guard:</b> Up there!\\n</p><p><i>(Frollo goes to swing again.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Quasimodo:</b> Hang on!\\n</p><p><i>(Quasi swings off again, just narrowly missing Frollo\\'s sword. Finally, Frollo gets Quasi cornered.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> I should have known you\\'d risk your life to save that gypsy witch. Just as your own mother died trying to save you.\\n</p><p><b>Quasimodo</b>: What!?!\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> Now I\\'m going to do what I should have done twenty years ago!\\n</p><p><i>(He swings his cape, covering Quasi\\'s head. But as he tries to throw Quasi off the balcony, the panicking Quasi pulls Frollo off as well. Now Frollo is hanging onto Quasi, who is hanging onto Esmeralda. Frollo throws his cape around another gargoyle, and pulls himself over. He stands up and is about to swing at Esmeralda.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Frollo:</b> And He shall smite the wicked and plunge them into the fiery pit! <i>(his last words from the Bible.)</i>\\n</p><p><i>(The gargoyle, however, begins to crack. Frollo is thrown off balance, and hangs onto the gargoyle\\'s head. Suddenly, the \\'goyle comes to life and roars. Frollo screams, and the now stone gargoyle breaks off, sending Frollo falling into the lava to his death. Meanwhile, Esmeralda is losing her grip on Quasimodo.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Esmeralda:</b> Quasimodo! Quasi!\\n</p><p><i>(He slips loose and begins to fall.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Esmeralda:</b> No!!!\\n</p><p><i>(He falls right along the building, close enough for Phoebus to catch him several floors below and pull him back into the building. When Quasi sees who has caught him, he and Phoebus hug. Esmeralda comes running in. After Esmeralda hugs him, he takes Esmeralda\\'s hand and Phoebus\\' hand, and puts them together. They kiss, and Quasi smiles broadly. Cut to ground level, where Phoebus and Esmeralda emerge into the light. As the crowd cheers, Esmeralda turns back to the open doorway. She comes back and leads out Quasimodo. The crowd goes silent. Soon, a little girl cautiously comes forward from the crowd. She looks at him, then pets his face. They then hug, and Quasi picks her up and put her up on his shoulder. The crowd begins to cheer. As he moves into the crowd, they do not move away as before. The \\'goyles are above, breaking out the champagne.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Clopin:</b> Three cheers for Quasimodo!!\\n</p><p><i>(The crowd breaks into loud cheering.)</i>\\n</p><p><b>Clopin:</b> SO...<br/>\\nHERE IS A RIDDLE YOU NEVER CAN GUESS<br/>\\nSING THE BELLS OF NOTRE DAME!<br/>\\nWHAT MAKES A MONSTER, AND WHAT MAKES A MAN?<br/>\\nSING THE BELLS, BELLS, BELLS, BELLS...<br/>\\n</p><p>WHATEVER THEIR PITCH, YOU CAN HEAR THEM BEWITCH YOU,<br/>\\nTHE RICH AND THE RITUAL KNELLS,<br/>\\nOF THE BELLS OF NOTRE DAME!<br/>\\n</p><p><i>(A long pullout, as we see the crowd following Quasi, then the \\'goyles looking over them.
