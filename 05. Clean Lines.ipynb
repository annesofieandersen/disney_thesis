      "well hen, it looks like i will still be an assistant pig-keeper, even when i am as old as dallben. you like that, do not you. now for the part you like best. taran begins to scrub hen wen's back. she settles herself down, but a concerned look soon overcomes her face, then that face turns to terror. hen jumps up, and squeals madly.\n",
      "only i knew the secret of hen wen's power! but now the horned king has discovered it! you must make sure he never uses it to find the black cauldron!\n",
      "so much. so soon. to rest upon his young sholders! now we see a castle with gwythaints swooping around it, and we zero in on the courtroom filled with skeletons that are clothed, and armed with weapons. we see a robed figure at the top of the stairs. the robe is crimson, and a fur stole is wrapped around the neck, and held by a gold broach. the fur stole trails down the figure's back 'till it reaches the ground. huge horns stick straight out of the figure's head, ripped through the hood of the robe. now we realize that the figure is the horned king, the exact one dallben fears and spoke of. the horned king quietly walks down the stairs and begins to talk to his lifeless skeleton warriors. horned\n",
      "gosh hen wen! i never knew you could create visions and things like that! i thought you were just an ordinary pig. i had no idea you so.. special. dallben's going to be glad he put his trust in me! just you wait and see! now, do not go wandering about! and do not you worry! keep close to me and no one will do you any harm.not while i am around. and i will not let the horned king get close to you hen. i will protect you! the\n",

      "if great lord go into evil castle, poor gurgi will never see his friend again! nope! never! now we see taran trying to get inside the castle and he is climbing a wall, he sees a beam of light and sees he has found a window. taran tears away the branch that blocked the window, and he climbs inside. taran looks around the strange hallway. quietly he gets up, and begins to search for hen wen. as he rounds a corner, taran hears a snort. carefully taran looks around to see a guard sleeping, his head resting on a table. taran quickly slips past the guard, but looks back to make sure he was not seen. then the guard dog sees taran and barks visously at him. the guard wakes up, but instead of looking to see what the dog was barking at, the guard yanks the dog's leash.\n",
      "welcome your majesty! we are celebrating our success! i-i-i mean your success! we have made no mistakes this time ! bring in the prisoner! there sire! this is the pig that creates visions! alright pig! show his majesty where the black cauldron can be found! go on, show it! heh, heh! stubborn little thing, is not she? heh, heh. why yes, sire. you are quite right! i will take take care of it at once! the black cauldron! where is it? show us, swine! i warn you! the king's patience is short!\n",
      "the black cauldron! so it does exist for sure! yes. where is it? show me. show me! the horned king lunges at taran. taran cries out in terror, and backs away spilling the water where visions are taking place. the water hits the horned king's 'eyes' and he screams in fury and in pain. taran scrambles to his feet and picks up hen wen.\n",
      "o! how interesting! well, you better stay close to me or you will get lost. the bauble flies around the dark passages that no one but eilonwy has been in for years. the bauble chases the rats that live in the passages, for eilonwy dosen't like them.\n",
      "this will please him! piece of good luck this time! hurry! in with it! hurry! he will reward me for this! do not stop you weakling! put your back into it! creeper is leading the henchmen, who is pulling a cart but you cannot see who or what is on it because it is covered by a sheet, into one of the horned king's rooms. before creeper closes the doors behind him an arm belonging to a skeleton warrior drags behind the cart. the doors close, the coast is clear.\n",
      "pig- boy's escaped! look in there!\n",
      "you? oh! great belin! run! run! make haste! make haste? i have must save myself! taran and eilonwy run for dear life. taran would have have made it across the parapet if he had not tripped on a flagstone. eilonwy, not seeing taran's fault, keeps on going. as taran gets up he realizes the sword is gone. taran looks around him and sees that the sword has fallen in the ditch that is aside the parapet. hearing the henchmen, taran jumps into the ditch and, grabbing the sword, crawls underneath one of the arches of the parapet. the henchmen pass over him, without being seen. when they are gone, taran climbs on the parapet and searches for eilonwy.\n",
      "pig-boy! you little scut! with a single blow with his hand, the henchmen sends taran sprawling. the henchmen takes out his axe and swings at taran, missing him only by a hair! taran grabs onto a beam to help him get on his feet. the henchmen swings again, missing taran but his axe is caught in the beam. taran sees that his only hope is the sword. taran grabs the sword and holds it to fend off any blows the henchmen may bring upon him. the henchmen has pulled his axe free of the beam and is going to chop taran in half. the henchmen brings his axe down on taran's sword. there is a bright light as the two weapons clash. the henchmen's axe shudders and breaks into a million pieces. frightened, the henchmen backs away. taran now realizes that the sword he holds is magic. taran also realizes that he is invinsible with the sword. taran laughs madly as he get up and swings the sword around. eilonwy walks in on the scene and looks at taran like he is gone crazy.\n",
      "ah!!! taran pulls on eilonwy's hand and drags her behind him as he runs through the castle with the magic sword in hand, trying to find a way out of the castle.\n",
      "run, princess! run! the gate comes down, tearing fflewddur's pants, he runs off holding up what is left of them.\n",
      "why did not you tell me you had a magic sword?!?!? we return just in time to see creeper report the escape of the 'pig boy', the princess, and the bard. creeper is climbing the staircase to the horned king's room. nervous about what the king might do to him.\n",
      "oh, yes, sire! oh, yes! by all means, sire! now we see gwythaints searching for the trio. though taran, fflewddur, and eilonwy are out of sight of the gwythaints. they rest in a glade. taran is polishing the magic sword. eilonwy is sewing the rip in fflewddur's pants made by the guard dog. fflewddur stands behind a bush with his boxers on, making up a song about himself.\n",
      "you?! i would say it was the sword's magic.\n",
      "girl? girl?!?! if it were not for this, girl, you would still be in the horned king's dungeon!\n",
      "silly girl! even if she is a princess! eilonwy is obviously very hurt by taran's last remark. now we get a hint that eilonwy likes taran. eilonwy and taran walk off in different directions, leaving fflewddur all by himself.\n",
      "ha, ha! gurgi's lucky day! wow!\n",
      "gurgi, uh, want!!! gurgi tries to pull the harp away, but the string is around fflewddur's neck. practically chocking fflewddur, gurgi gives one last pull when taran shows up at the scene with the magic sword drawn.\n",
      "gurgi! gurgi quickly let us the harp go, sending it smashing into fflewddur's head. gurgi studders trying to think of an excuse.\n",
      "he is no friend of mine. he is just a coward, and a thief. gurgi takes of fflewddur's hat and gives it back.\n",
      "humph! gurgi go! tracks? tracks! gurgi remembers! saw piggy's tracks!\n",
      "gurgi not lie. not this time. the companions follow gurgi. soon they come to a small pond. where gurgi proudly shows taran hen wen's tracks.\n",
      "see master? piggy's footsteps! no lie.\n",
      "ha! old doli's whirpool broke again! little\n",
      "me either! uhoh! king eidilleg has come to inspect how the fixing of the whirpool is comingg. doli, eidilleg's grumpy, hot-tempered, sharp-witted servent, is trying to fix the whirlpool.\n",
      "and i suppose it is my fault that the pig's here, too!\n",
      "doli's right. it is my fault! i let you down! without my sword i am nothing! i am just an just an assistant pig-keeper!\n",
      "ha! there you are! pig-boy! gurgi looks on and lowers head as if in shame. taran, princess eilonwy, and fflewdduf fflam are taken back to the horned king's castle we see the king's courtroom that is filled with the lifeless skeleton warriors. creeper is on a platform with the black cauldron, yelling out orders.\n",
      "get the move on! careful now! you! tie them up over there and get that cart out of here! oh, i 'm sorry. i have ignored you. you did come for the black cauldron? good, then climb right in! it will only cost you your life! oh!! everything is ready, sire! horned\n",
      "you will satsify the cauldron's hunger! the horned king throws taran towarn the cauldron. taran, too weak to move, lays still. pleased with his work, makes his way toward the staircase leading to his balconey. taran, seeing that he is leaving, crawls away from the cauldrom. eilonwy and fflewddur watch nervously from a parapat above.\n",
      "oh no! h-how horrible! poor sire! h-he is gone! he is gone! ha! he is gone! ha, ha, ha, ha! he is gone! the cauldron's inrush of air has stopped. now it has turned a molten gold and is causing the floor to collapse. taran flees looking for eilonwy and fflewddur.\n",
      "for sakes alive! they come to a spot where the floor has split. taran jumps over first, then eilonwy. fflewddur dosen't like the idea.\n",
      "just as i thought ladies! you have got no real power! admit it! admit it! the witches are insulted by fflewddur's remark. the dissappear into a whirlwind. and circle around the cauldron.\n",
      "we have made a bargain! ha, ha, ha, ha! the wind funnels in front of taran, eilonwy, and fflewddur. suddenly it disappears and the still body of gurgi lays on the ground. taran quietly walks forward and picks up gurgi's body. he turns around and faces his friends.\n",
      "oh, taran! taran's eyes fills with tears and he hugs gurgi's body. then he quickly looks away. suddenly a little paw slips into his vest as if in search of an apple.\n",
      "i am alive! ha ha ha! gurgi's alive! look! look! look! touch me! oh! ho, ho!\n",
      "oh! gurgi's happy day! gurgi runs forward and grabs taran's hand, taran looks at eilonwy and holds his hand out to her and she takes it. then eilonwy holds her hand out to fflewddur and he taks it.\n",
      "great belin! ha! the characters walk off together and their image turns into one of hen wen's visions. you then see, dallben, hen wen and doli back at caer dallben. dallben is smiling.\n",
